        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p3>To whom it may concern, my name is Edgar David Ayala I was born in Ecuador and moved here at the age of seven. My main hobby is the pursuit of knowledge.  Therefore, I am always seeking that next great challenge in my life. Ive taken up everything from playing guitar and piano to drawing and buying a microscope use for fun. Ive always been curios to find out how things work. As a child I will get a new toy and instead of playing with it I would take it apart and play with the electric motors to build something new and unique. My happiness comes from the drop of serotonin and dopamine I get from learning something new. Since the universe is expanding and there is always an infinite amount of knowledge. I will never be sad because I can always learn something new. I have hopes thatâ€™s Artificial Intelligence will be humanities crown achievement and if I can even take a small part in that my life will be complete.</p3>
